# Data Gathering from Bernat 2021

Some scripts to aggregate antibody sequences and results metadata from:

Vázquez Bernat, Néstor et al.  Rhesus and cynomolgus macaque immunoglobulin heavy-chain genotyping yields comprehensive databases of germline VDJ alleles.  Immunity, Volume 54, Issue 2, 355 - 366.e4 <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2020.12.018>

Final allele sequences, straight from the source: <http://kimdb.gkhlab.se/datasets/>

GenBank accession ranges, for final allele sequences:

 * MT561887-MT563069
 * MT643213-MT643227
 * MT672244-MT672249
 * MT542339-MT542468
 * MT643195-MT643212
 * MT643228-MT643233

ENA accession ranges, for read libraries:

 * ERR4250665-ERR4250672
 * ERR4238026-ERR4238115

## Table S5

 * S5A: IGHV (all)
 * S5B: IGHV (rhesus)
 * S5C: IGHV (cynomolgus)
 * S5D: IGHD
 * S5E: IGHJ

> For an overview of the different types of validation approaches provided for
> each IGHV alleles, we generated a summary showing the alleles that were
> validated by targeted genomic PCR, which were found previously reported by
> BLAST query of GenBank-deposited macaque germline sequences or previous genomic
> assemblies, and which were found in both leader and UTR primer-generated
> Rep-seq libraries (Table S5A). Table S5A also shows in how many animals each
> allele was found, as well as whether it was found in Indian- or Chinese-origin
> rhesus macaques or Indonesian- or Mauritius-origin cynomolgus macaques, or
> whether it was found in several of these sub-groups. We also generated separate
> tables containing information for all IGHV alleles found in the rhesus macaques
> (Table S5B) and cynomolgus macaques (Table S5C), as well as separate tables for
> all IGHD alleles (Table S5D) and IGHJ alleles (Table S5E). All of the primers
> used for targeted genomic PCR and Sanger sequencing of IGHV, IGHD, and IGHJ
> alleles are summarized in Tables S6A–S6C.
